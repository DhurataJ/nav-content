# The Quickbooks Payroll File Import Extension to Dynamics NAV
To account for salary payments and related transactions, you must import and post financial transactions made by your payroll provider to the general ledger.

To do this, you first import a file that you receive from the payroll provider into the **General Journal** window. Then you map the external accounts in the payroll file to the relevant G/L accounts. Lastly, you post the payroll transactions according to the account mapping. For more information, see [How to: Import Payroll Transactions](finance-how-import-payroll-transactions.md).

The Quickbooks Payroll File Import extension allows you to import payroll transaction from the Quickbooks Payroll service.
