# How to: Generate Delivery Reminders - Switzerland
In [!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/navnow_md.md)], you can create delivery reminders when a purchase has not been delivered as expected. You can generate delivery reminders for all overdue deliveries, or you can create a single delivery reminder manually. For more information, see [How to: Create Delivery Reminders Manually](how-to-create-delivery-reminders-manually.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
>  To create delivery reminders, you must set up the delivery reminder properties. For more information, see [How to: Set Up Delivery Reminders](how-to-set-up-delivery-reminders.md).  

## To generate delivery reminders for all overdue deliveries  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Delivery Reminder**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Choose the **New** action.  
3.  In the **Delivery Reminder** window, choose the **Create Delivery Reminder** action.  
4.  On the **Purchase Header** FastTab and the **Purchase Line** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.  
5.  Choose the **OK** button.  

If there are overdue deliveries that match the filters that you have set, deliver reminders are created. You can now issue and print the delivery reminders.
